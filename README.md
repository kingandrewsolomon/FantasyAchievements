# ESPN Fantasy Football Team Analyzer

I created this project to create another competition throughout our league. I have defined 27 different Achievements for my league members to try to achieve each week.

This was a fork from tbryan2 [espnfantasyfootball](https://github.com/tbryan2/espnfantasyfootball).

Also wanted to thank [red-green-factor](https://red-green-refactor.com/2020/06/29/retrieve-fantasy-football-stats-using-espns-api-part-3/) for a wonderful blogpost on how to dissect the data.
